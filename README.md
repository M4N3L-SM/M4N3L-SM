## 👋 About Me

Hey! I’m **Manel** (aka **M4N3L**) — a systems administrator on a journey to becoming a proper **DevOps** someday 😄  
I've been working for the last 3 years as SysAdmin on various VFX companies. 
This GitHub is my little playground: scripts, tools, and experiments—mostly things that solve real problems or scratch an itch.

## 🛠️ Skills
- Linux & Windows wizardry
- Bash, PowerShell & small scripting hacks
- Monitoring, networking & keeping things fast and secure

I’m always up for geeking out, learning new tricks, or building cool tools. Feel free to reach out or connect on LinkedIn. Let’s make tech a bit more fun.
